# 🧠 Introduction

Welcome to the **Concepts** section of the AI Model Playground. This page introduces foundational ideas behind artificial intelligence, with a focus on intelligent agents and their behavior.

## 📘 Definitions

### 🧠 Intelligence
**Intelligence** refers to the capacity of an entity to understand, perceive, reason, learn, manipulate, and predict information.  
The more effectively an entity performs these functions, the more intelligent it is considered to be.

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to non-biological systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.  
These entities are typically designed and created by humans to perform tasks that require intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and decision making.

### 🕵️ Agent
An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators.  
It may be a physical robot or a software program.

### 🎯 Rationality
**Rationality** is the principle of taking actions that maximize an agent’s expected performance, based on the information it has.  
A rational agent chooses actions expected to lead to the most desirable outcomes, as defined by a performance measure or goal.

### 🧮 Logical Reasoning
**Logical reasoning** is a formal process by which an agent draws conclusions from a set of premises or known facts.  
It involves applying inference rules to derive logically valid conclusions, often used in knowledge-based systems.

## 🧭 The Rational Agent Model

According to the **standard model of AI**, the focus is primarily on **rational action**.

> An **ideal intelligent agent** takes the best possible action in a given situation to maximize performance.

## ⚙️ Characteristics of AI Applications

- **Learning Capability** – adapts based on data or environment
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** – uses statistical or rule-based methods
- **Automation** – performs tasks without human intervention
- **Adaptability** – adjusts behavior in dynamic environments
- **Scalability** – handles increasing complexity or data
- **Uncertainty Handling** – makes decisions with incomplete or probabilistic info
- **Generalization** – applies learned knowledge to new situations
