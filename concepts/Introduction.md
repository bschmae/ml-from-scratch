# Introduction

Welcome to the **Concepts** section of the AI Model Playground. This page introduces foundational ideas behind artificial intelligence, with a focus on intelligent agents and their behavior.

## üìò Definitions

### Intelligence
**Intelligence** refers to the capacity of an entity to understand, perceive, reason, learn, manipulate, and predict information.  
The more effectively an entity performs these functions, the more intelligent it is considered to be.

### Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to non-biological systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.  
These entities are typically designed and created by humans to perform tasks that require intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and decision making.

### Agent
An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators.  
It may be a physical robot or a software program.

### Rationality
**Rationality** is the principle of taking actions that maximize an agent‚Äôs expected performance, based on the information it has.  
A rational agent chooses actions expected to lead to the most desirable outcomes, as defined by a performance measure or goal.

### Logical Reasoning
**Logical reasoning** is a formal process by which an agent draws conclusions from a set of premises or known facts.  
It involves applying inference rules to derive logically valid conclusions, often used in knowledge-based systems.

## The Rational Agent Model

According to the **standard model of AI**, the focus is primarily on **rational action**.

> An **ideal intelligent agent** takes the best possible action in a given situation to maximize performance.

## Characteristics of AI Applications

- **Learning Capability** ‚Äì adapts based on data or environment
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** ‚Äì uses statistical or rule-based methods
- **Automation** ‚Äì performs tasks without human intervention
- **Adaptability** ‚Äì adjusts behavior in dynamic environments
- **Scalability** ‚Äì handles increasing complexity or data
- **Uncertainty Handling** ‚Äì makes decisions with incomplete or probabilistic info
- **Generalization** ‚Äì applies learned knowledge to new situations

## Is AI science or engineerin?
AI is both a science and engineering. Computer engineering is useful in the realm of AI in that it provides the ever-more powerful machines that make AI possible, and software engineering makes them more usable. The domain of AI is a science in that in embodies many different areas of research and experimentation to learn more about the nature of intelligence in general. So yes, AI is both because it requires understanding and constructing.

## Influences on AI Research
**Philosophers** made the concept of AI conceivable by proposing that the mind functions similarly to a machine. Like machines, the mind takes in input (perceptions), processes it internally (reasoning, emotions, memory), and produces output (actions or decisions). These early ideas laid the foundation for viewing intelligence as a computational process.

**Mathematicians** contributed formal systems of logic and tools to manipulate both certain and uncertain statements. These tools provided the groundwork for algorithmic reasoning, probabilistic inference, and computational models‚Äîcore components of AI.

**Economists** developed formal models for decision-making in competitive and non-competitive environments, focusing on utility maximization. These concepts strongly influence AI subfields such as game theory, decision theory, and reinforcement learning.

**Neuroscientists** have uncovered how different parts of the brain function and interact. Their findings continue to inform AI by highlighting both parallels and distinctions between biological neural systems and artificial models, inspiring areas like neural networks and deep learning.

**Psychologists** extended the notion that humans and animals process information similarly to machines. Their work on cognition, language processing, and mental representation of knowledge helped shape cognitive models in AI.

**Control theorists** focus on designing systems that adjust their behavior based on feedback from the environment. This field directly informs robotics, adaptive systems, and AI agents that act optimally in dynamic environments.

## Food for Thought

**‚ÄúSurely computers cannot be intelligent ‚Äî they can do only what their programmers tell them.‚Äù**

The latter statement is partially true but it does not imply the former. Computers operate according to instructions whether they are hardcoded or learned. Traditional programs do exactly what they are programmed to do. ML systems are not told how to solve a problem, they are given data and learn from it. In this case the programmer designs the system, but doesn‚Äôt explicitly code the outcomes or sometimes even the intermediary steps.

The former implication is flawed because it assumes a narrow definition of intelligence. If intelligence means hard-coding, then yes ‚Äî computers aren't intelligent. But if intelligence includes learning, adapting, making decisions, then modern AI systems show forms of intelligence.

**"Surely animals cannot be intelligent ‚Äî they can do only what their genes tell them.‚Äù**
This statement oversimplifies animal behavior. While it's true that simpler animals often operate based on instinctual, genetically programmed behavior, this doesn't hold for all species. There is a broad spectrum of complexity in the animal kingdom, and with it comes a range of cognitive abilities.

In more advanced species we see clear evidence of intelligence. These animals can learn from experience, solve novel problems, adapt to new environments, and make decisions that go beyond simple genetic programming.
Their behaviors often reflect memory, reasoning, planning, and even emotional understanding.

So while genetics certainly provide a foundation, they do not fully determine behavior in more complex animals. Intelligence exists across many species and is demonstrated through learning, flexibility, and problem-solving abilities.
