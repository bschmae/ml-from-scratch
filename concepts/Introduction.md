## üìò Definitions

### Intelligence
**Intelligence** refers to the capacity of an entity to understand, perceive, reason, learn, manipulate, and predict information.  
The more effectively an entity performs these functions, the more intelligent it is considered to be.

### Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to non-biological systems that exhibit intelligent behavior.  
These entities are typically designed and created by humans to perform tasks that require intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, and decision making.

### Agent
An **agent** is anything that can perceive its environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators.  
It may be a physical robot or a software program.

### Rationality
**Rationality** is the principle of taking actions that maximize an agent‚Äôs expected performance, based on the information it has.  
A rational agent chooses actions expected to lead to the most desirable outcomes, as defined by a performance measure or goal.

### Logical Reasoning
**Logical reasoning** is a formal process by which an agent draws conclusions from a set of premises or known facts.  
It involves applying inference rules to derive logically valid conclusions, often used in knowledge-based systems.

## The Rational Agent Model

According to the **standard model of AI**, the focus is primarily on **rational action**.

> An **ideal intelligent agent** takes the best possible action in a given situation to maximize performance.

## Is AI science or engineering?
AI is both a science and engineering. Computer engineering is useful in the realm of AI in that it provides the ever-more powerful machines that make AI possible, and software engineering makes them more usable. The domain of AI is a science in that in embodies many different areas of research and experimentation to learn more about the nature of intelligence in general. So yes, AI is both because it requires understanding and constructing.

## Influences on AI Research
**Philosophers** made the concept of AI conceivable by proposing that the mind functions similarly to a machine. Like machines, the mind takes in input (perceptions), processes it internally (reasoning, emotions, memory), and produces output (actions or decisions). These early ideas laid the foundation for viewing intelligence as a computational process.

**Mathematicians** contributed formal systems of logic and tools to manipulate both certain and uncertain statements. These tools provided the groundwork for algorithmic reasoning, probabilistic inference, and computational models‚Äîcore components of AI.

**Economists** developed formal models for decision-making in competitive and non-competitive environments, focusing on utility maximization. These concepts strongly influence AI subfields such as game theory, decision theory, and reinforcement learning.

**Neuroscientists** have uncovered how different parts of the brain function and interact. Their findings continue to inform AI by highlighting both parallels and distinctions between biological neural systems and artificial models, inspiring areas like neural networks and deep learning.

**Psychologists** extended the notion that humans and animals process information similarly to machines. Their work on cognition, language processing, and mental representation of knowledge helped shape cognitive models in AI.

**Control theorists** focus on designing systems that adjust their behavior based on feedback from the environment. This field directly informs robotics, adaptive systems, and AI agents that act optimally in dynamic environments.

## Food for Thought

#### Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?

Reflexive actions could be seen as rational actions. Although a reflexive action is involuntary or unconsciously performed if we view rationally from a broader teleological position, it still has the potential to be rational. If we define rationality as the ability to perform an action to maximize some performance measure. In this case the performance measure could be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt allow harm to occur to your physical body‚Äù, then the reflex could be seen as a pre-programmed rational action. Intelligence usually includes the notion of practical reasoning among other things. But because intelligence usually includes more methodical, deliberate, abstract processes and the ability to reason and learn to build some connection between precepts and actions I would not claim that a reflexive action is an intelligent action. A reflexive action is more hardwired into the system and therefore does not really involve any of the various facets that are used to characterize intelligence.

#### Why would evolution tend to result in systems that act rationally? What goals are such systems designed to achieve?

Evolution tends to result in systems that act rationally because the performance measure or rather objective/goal of evolutionary systems is to survive and reproduce. To successfully achieve these evolutionary goals the systems that are more rational, that is, the systems that perform some action that maximizes their ‚Äúfitness‚Äù or ability to survive and reproduce outcompete other systems, resulting in a trend to ever increasing rational systems as they triumph over less rational systems.

#### There are well-known classes of problems that are intractably difficult for computers, and other classes that are provably undecidable. Does this mean that AI is impossible?

No, the existence of intractable and undecidable problems does not mean that AI is impossible. These limitations simply define the boundaries of what any computational system (including AI) can or cannot do ‚Äî but they do not invalidate the vast range of problems that can be solved effectively with AI. Intractable problems are problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time. Roughly speaking, if the time required to solve instances of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the instances the problem is intractable. However, many real-world instances of these problems are tractable in practice using heuristics, approximations, or probabilistic methods. AI is not about solving every imaginable problem. It is about building systems that behave intelligently within realistic constraints. The fact that some problems are unsolvable or inefficient to solve does not undermine all problems.

#### ‚ÄúSurely computers cannot be intelligent ‚Äî they can do only what their programmers tell them.‚Äù

The latter statement is partially true but it does not imply the former. Computers operate according to instructions whether they are hardcoded or learned. Traditional programs do exactly what they are programmed to do. ML systems are not told how to solve a problem, they are given data and learn from it. In this case the programmer designs the system, but doesn‚Äôt explicitly code the outcomes or sometimes even the intermediary steps.

The former implication is flawed because it assumes a narrow definition of intelligence. If intelligence means hard-coding, then yes ‚Äî computers aren't intelligent. But if intelligence includes learning, adapting, making decisions, then modern AI systems show forms of intelligence.

#### "Surely animals cannot be intelligent ‚Äî they can do only what their genes tell them.‚Äù

This statement oversimplifies animal behavior. While it's true that simpler animals often operate based on instinctual, genetically programmed behavior, this doesn't hold for all species. There is a broad spectrum of complexity in the animal kingdom, and with it comes a range of cognitive abilities.

In more advanced species we see clear evidence of intelligence. These animals can learn from experience, solve novel problems, adapt to new environments, and make decisions that go beyond simple genetic programming.
Their behaviors often reflect memory, reasoning, planning, and even emotional understanding.

So while genetics certainly provide a foundation, they do not fully determine behavior in more complex animals. Intelligence exists across many species and is demonstrated through learning, flexibility, and problem-solving abilities.

#### Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent -- they can only do what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physic?

In the physicalist or reductionaist view, yes, everything in the universe including humans, animals, and computers is made of particles obeying physical laws (e.g., quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, etc.). This knowledge of the universe and its physical laws tends to lead to the conclusion that intelligence must be an illusion. After all, if our actions are fully determined by the laws of physics, can we really say that anything is "intelligent" in a meaningful sense?

It‚Äôs uncontroversial (in most scientific circles) that all matter behaves in accordance with physical laws. Molecules interact by the rules of chemistry, chemistry arises from physics, and so on. This includes the atoms that make up brains and computers. But acknowledging this doesn't, by itself, explain the origin or nature of high-level behaviors like intelligence or consciousness.

This reasoning often takes the following form:

All physical systems, including brains and computers, are composed of atoms.

Atoms strictly obey the laws of physics.

Therefore, the behavior of any system is just atoms following these laws.

Hence, intelligence cannot be ‚Äúreal‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs just atoms doing what they‚Äôre told.

While the first two premises are broadly accepted in the scientific worldview, the conclusion does not necessarily follow. The idea that intelligence is invalidated by physical determinism reflects a misunderstanding of **emergence** ‚Äî a key concept in both physics and complex systems.

**Warning On the Term Emergence**
This is where many people invoke the concept of emergence and where we must tread carefully. Emergence is often described as the appearance of new properties or behaviors when simpler units interact in complex ways. For example, the liquidity of water isn't a feature of any one H‚ÇÇO molecule; it "emerges" when many molecules interact.

Similarly, some argue that intelligence is an emergent property of neural activity. This sounds appealing, but it‚Äôs not a sufficient explanation. Simply pointing to emergence often amounts to saying, ‚Äúa complicated thing came out of simpler parts,‚Äù without actually explaining how or why. It risks what I refer to as being "a mysterious answer to a mysterious question" ‚Äî a kind of intellectual placeholder.

While the term may help categorize the type of problem we‚Äôre facing, it doesn't eliminate the depth of the mystery. The explanatory gap between physics and cognition remains largely unbridged.

Despite this gap, it doesn‚Äôt follow that intelligence is unreal or meaningless. We don‚Äôt dismiss the reality of temperature just because it emerges from molecular motion. Likewise, intelligence can be real and functionally significant, even if we don't fully understand the bridge from neuron to thought or atom to awareness.

From a pragmatic standpoint, intelligence describes a system‚Äôs ability to learn, adapt, and solve problems. Whether in animals, humans, or AI agents, these behaviors are observable, quantifiable, and impactful even if their ultimate origin in physical law remains conceptually elusive.
