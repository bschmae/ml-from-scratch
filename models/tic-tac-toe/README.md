Tic-Tac-Toe AI

1. The Problem Space
    Tic-Tac-Toe is a finite, fully obseravable, zero-sum, turn based game.

    • Finite: the game as a limited number of possible states and moves and 
    it always ends.

    • Fully observable: if an agent's has access to the complete state 
    of the environment at each point in time, then we say the task environment
    is fully observable.

    • Zero-sum: one player's gain is another player's loss. Total utility is
    always zero.
